				<li>Drag this new folder into your 'week3' folder inside your 'codify' folder.</li>
				<li>In HTML: Create a navbar with 5 functional links.</li>
				<li>In CSS: Add a hover effect to the links.</li>
				<li>In HTML: Create three button elements.</li>
				<li>In CSS: Add different styles to each button to make them have a flat design (for examples of "flat" buttons, click <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">here</a>).</li>
				<li>In Browser: Go to Github and create a repository that is named the same as your week 3 classwork folder.</li>
				<li>Open Terminal (Mac) or Git Bash (Windows) and navigate to your classwork folder for the week. Remember where your classwork folder is (desktop > codify > week# > classworkfolder). Use the commands cd (change directory) and ls (lists current files in the selected directory) to navigate through your files using the command line.</li>
