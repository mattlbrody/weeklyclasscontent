				<li>Drag this new folder into your 'week14' folder inside your 'codify' folder.</li>
				<li>When working through these exercises, there are bits and pieces of the instructions that are deliberately left out. You should start thinking about what you THINK you will need in order to accomplish the request.</li>
				<li>Visit <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/google_maps_basic.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools Google Maps Basics</a></li>
				<li>In HTML and CSS: Create an element to display the map. Make sure to your element has some width and height so there is 'space' for the map.</li>
				<li>In HTML: Add a script tag to include the Google Maps API.</li>
				<li>In JS: Create a function to add the map, with one variable for map properties. Update the location to your favorite place on Earth.</li>

				<li>In JS: Add the map to the screen using the google.maps.Map method.</li>
				<li>In W3Schools: Move to the next section Maps Overlays.</li>
				<li>In JS: Create a marker and set the position to mapProp.center. Add the marker to the map using the Google setMap method.</li>

				<li>In W3Schools: Move to the next section Maps Events.</li>
				<li>In JS: Using the google.maps.event.addListener method, add an event so when you click on the marker it zooms in on the map marker.</li>

			<h1 class="section-header">Project</h1>
			<p>Today we will start creating a project using the Google Books API.</p>
			<p>Using the google books api, we will request data based on the user input (either title or author of a book) and display the data returned from the API, to the user.</p>

			<p>We want to display the  author's name, the published date, an image of the book, and a link to learn more about the book. All of this info is included in the JSON data.</p>
			<h4 class="steps">Steps For Making this JavaScript Project - Remember to break this project into manageable steps:</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Paper Prototype the layout of the project (draw out how you want the app to look) we will include each author's name, the published date, an image of each book, and a link to learn more about each book.</li>
				<li>Create the HTML needed to accept user data, a button to run the search function and a place to display the results.</li>
				<li>Style the project with flat design CSS, ideally something from codepen you modify to make your own.</li>
				<li>Write pseudocode for the JavaScript Logic (this is a halfway point between plain English and JavaScript).</li>
				<li>Write the JavaScript to capture user data, adding the answers to an array and displaying the results in the console.</li>
