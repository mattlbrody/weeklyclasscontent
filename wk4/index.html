				<li>Create a copy of your template folder and rename it to week4exercise.</li>
				<li>Drag this new folder into your 'week4' folder inside your 'codify' folder.</li>
				<li>In HTML: Create 4 div elements. Each with a class of box and a second class. The second class can be any color you want - we will set the background-color of each div to the color of the second class. <pre>ex: &lt;div class="box red"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</pre></li>
				<li>In CSS: Select the body element and add text-align center as a property and value.</li>
				<li>In CSS: Select the class of box and add 3 properties display, height &amp; width.</li>
				<li>In CSS: Select the second class of each div (they should be different class names) and add a background color to each selector each with a different color. <pre>ex: .red { background-color: red; }</pre></li>
				<li>In CSS: Using media queries make it so that the 2nd and 3rd div elements disappear when you SHRINK the screen size below 600px.</li>
				<li>In CSS: Using media queries make it so that all of the divs have their width extended to 100% of the screen when you INCREASE the screen size beyond 1000px.</li>

			<p>This week we will focus on adding media queries to our previous projects so they look good on any screen size. We will begin with making our very first project a responsive website.</p>
			<h4 class="steps">Steps For Making a Website Responsive</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Begin by adding the meta viewport tag into the head of the document, otherwise your media queries won't work. Refer back to Week 3 in Litmos to remind yourself how to write it out or Google it!</li>
				<li>Once you have your meta viewport tag in your head you can begin to add in media queries to your CSS.</li>
				<li>Inspect your site in browser and use the Google Responsive Developer Tool to resize the screen, when elements start to look bad at any screen size that's where you will add a media query.</li>
				<li>When you're happy with how the website looks from 400px - 1200px then validate your CSS code to make sure there are no new errors.</li>
				<li>Upload your updated project to Github following the steps in "How to Update a Existing Project on Github" from week 2.</li>
				<li>Once your done check off in Litmos Week 4 that the in class project is complete.</li>
