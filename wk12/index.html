				<li>In JS: Loop through the array and round all numbers to the nearest whole integer. Add each rounded number to a new array.</li>
				<li>In JS: Create a function that produces 10 random numbers between 1 and 100. Add each number to an array of numbers.</li>
				<li>In JS: Write out a function that creates a few variables that stores the following information: the whole date, the current hour, the current minute, and the current second.</li>
