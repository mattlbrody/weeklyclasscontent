			<p>This week we will be building a website for a business. Before starting this project, you will need to decide on what type of business this will be for. This is a great time to build a website for a family member or friend. If they decide to use it, that's another reference you'll have added to your resume as a professional developer! If there isn't anyone you want to build a website for, then build one for a business you want to have. Just make sure that whatever you decide to build, you're passionate about it.</p>
			<h4 class="steps">Steps For Making a Business Website</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>Decide on a business you want to build a website for.</li>
				<li>List out all the functionality you want to include in the business website. E.X. About me, contact us, services, testimonials, social media, etc.</li>
				<li>Paper prototype out how the website will look.</li>
				<li>Google "free bootstrap template", and choose one that looks similar to your paper prototype.</li>
				<li>Download the template &amp; uncompress(unzip) the folder then start manipulating the template to look like your paper prototype!</li>
				<li>Make sure to grab content from somewhere, don't spend much time finding/creating content for the website, we just need to make sure it looks good!</li>
